# ZeroTrustMesh-K8s
Implementing Zero Trust principles in containerized environments is crucial for securing East-West traffic, especially in the context of microservices communication. This project explores the integration of Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Anthos, and Istio to establish a robust security framework. 

This repository contains Terraform code to deploy Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) integrated with Anthos, providing a secure and scalable container orchestration environment.
